    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>Potatoes (finely cubes into small pieces)</li>
        <li>Half an onion (sliced and diced)</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Parsley</li>
        <li>Eggs (optional extra)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cooking Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat butter in a large skillet (preferably cast iron) on medium heat. Add the onion and cook a few minutes, until translucent</li>
        <li>Mix in the chopped corned beef and potatoes. Spread out evenly over the pan. Increase the heat to high or medium high and press down on the mixture with a metal spatula.</li>
        <li>Do not stir the potatoes and corned beef, but let them brown. If you hear them sizzling, this is good.

        Use a metal spatula to peek underneath and see if they are browning. If nicely browned, use the spatula to flip sections over in the pan so that they brown on the other side. Press down again with the spatula.
            
        If there is too much sticking, you can add a little more butter to the pan. Continue to cook in this manner until the potatoes and the corned beef are nicely browned.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat, stir in chopped parsley. Add plenty of freshly ground black pepper, and add salt to taste.</li>
        <li>To make this dish even more tasty why not fry a couple of eggs to go with it, you can always create holes in you hash while it's cooking and crack your eggs right into them to cook alongside</li>
    </ol>
